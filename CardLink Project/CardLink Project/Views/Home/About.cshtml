                            The CIS Mentor Program was created by CIS students. We worked with our client to discover all the business needs for this system.
                            Our team has thought about all the features that we would want from a mentor system, since we are students in CIS classes.
                            This mentor program was created to face several problems and aims to increase students continuing their CIS classes, and to increase CIS alumni participation.

                            Our purpose for creating this mentor program is to give students an additional resource for help in their classes.
                            CIS classes are difficult, sometimes students are not able to ask the questions that they want in class.
                            The mentor program aims to match students with a mentor who is like them in one way or more.

                            The mentor program also encourages graduates of the cis department at UofL to join.
                            hey can form mentorships with undergraduates. This is a good opportunity for alumni to give back tot heir department.
                            We also accept donations from anyone who supports our initiative for this program.
